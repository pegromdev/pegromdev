description: "Introducing My Self"
---

My name is Nicolas also know as pegrom or some call me a nerd or a geek depending on the subject.. 
People see my self as a very technical oriented person, because you are what people see and think of you or are you not? JUST KIDDING!

In 1995  thanks to a Friend who paid for me I sing up for computer classes to learn windows 95 and it was one of  those moments where you know passion is in you, then in 2002 I meet Linux, more exactly Red hat Linux and hey I fell in love for it... I won't go into anymore details because what I am trying to convey is that I been around for long and I know that I gonna be around for a while more... So lets discuss why I am here now shall we?

I am here to talk about Cyber Security for a few reasons like reinforce some knowledge, share and discuss basics tools and practices and most importantly practicing writing skills are just a few... The goal is to bring awareness and motivation on how to secure things, where to start or share about how i am planing to brake in the Cyber Security Field to those who are interested as I am.
